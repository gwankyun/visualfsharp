## Quick Start: Build, Test, Develop

You can build the compiler+tools and run the subset the tests used for continuous integration as follows:

    build.cmd

There are various qualifiers:

    build.cmd release         -- build release (the default)
    build.cmd debug           -- build debug instead of release

    build.cmd proto           -- force the rebuild of the Proto bootstrap compiler in addition to other things

    build.cmd compiler        -- build/tests only the compiler (not the Visual F# IDE Tools)
    build.cmd vs              -- build/tests the Visual F# IDE Tools
    build.cmd pcls            -- build/tests the PCL FSharp.Core libraries

    build.cmd build           -- build, do not test
    build.cmd ci              -- build, run the same tests as CI 
    build.cmd all             -- build, run all tests
    build.cmd notests         -- turn off testing (used in conjunction with other options)

    build.cmd test-smoke      -- build, run smoke tests
    build.cmd test-coreunit   -- build, run FSharp.Core tests
    build.cmd test-coreclr    -- build, run CoreCLR tests
    build.cmd test-pcls       -- build, run PCL tests
    build.cmd test-fsharp     -- build, run tests\fsharp suite
    build.cmd test-fsharpqa   -- build, run tests\fsharpqa suite
    build.cmd test-vs         -- build, run Visual F# IDE Tools unit tests

Combinations are also allowed:

    build.cmd debug,compiler,notests   -- build the debug compiler and run smoke tests

After you build the first time you can open and use this solution:

    .\VisualFSharp.sln

or just build it directly:

    msbuild VisualFSharp.sln 

Building ``VisualFSharp.sln`` builds _nearly_ everything. However building portable profiles of 
FSharp.Core.dll is not included.  If you are just developing the core compiler, library
and Visual F# Tools then building the solution will be enough.

## Step by Step: 

### 1. Building a Proto Compiler

The compiler is compiled as a set of .NET 4.0 components using a bootstrap process. 
This uses a Last Known Good (LKG) compiler checked into this repository to build.  

    msbuild src\fsharp-proto-build.proj
    
### 2.  Building an F# (Debug) library and compiler

This uses the proto compiler to build `FSharp.Core.dll`, `FSharp.Compiler.dll`, `fsc.exe`, and `fsi.exe`.

    msbuild src/fsharp-library-build.proj 
    msbuild src/fsharp-compiler-build.proj 
    
You can now use the updated F# compiler in `debug\net40\bin\fsc.exe` and F# Interactive in `debug\net40\bin\fsi.exe` to develop and test basic language and tool features.

**Note:** The updated library is not used until you run `update.cmd`, see below.  The updated compiler is not run 'pre-compiled' until you run `update.cmd -ngen`, see below.

### 3. Full Steps Before Running Tests

See [TESTGUIDE.md](TESTGUIDE.md) for full details on how to run tests.
    
Prior to a full **Debug** test run, you need to complete **all** of the steps in build.cmd

    build.cmd debug,build

Likewise prior to a **Release** test run:

    build.cmd release,build

For **Debug** this corresponds to these steps, which you can run individually for more incremental builds:

    msbuild src/fsharp-library-build.proj
    msbuild src/fsharp-compiler-build.proj
    msbuild src/fsharp-compiler-unittests-build.proj
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable47
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable7
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable78
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable259
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-unittests-build.proj
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-unittests-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable47
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-unittests-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable7
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-unittests-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable78
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-unittests-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable259
    msbuild vsintegration/fsharp-vsintegration-src-build.proj
    msbuild vsintegration/fsharp-vsintegration-project-templates-build.proj
    msbuild vsintegration/fsharp-vsintegration-item-templates-build.proj
    msbuild vsintegration/fsharp-vsintegration-deployment-build.proj
    msbuild vsintegration/fsharp-vsintegration-unittests-build.proj 
    msbuild tests/fsharp/FSharp.Tests.fsproj
    src\update.cmd debug -ngen
    tests\BuildTestTools.cmd debug 


For **Release** this corresponds to these steps, which you can run individually for more incremental builds:

    msbuild src/fsharp-library-build.proj  /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild src/fsharp-compiler-build.proj  /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild src/fsharp-compiler-unittests-build.proj  /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable47 /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable7 /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable78 /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable259 /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-unittests-build.proj  /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-unittests-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable47 /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-unittests-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable7 /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-unittests-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable78 /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild src/fsharp-library-unittests-build.proj /p:TargetFramework=portable259 /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild vsintegration/fsharp-vsintegration-src-build.proj /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild vsintegration/fsharp-vsintegration-project-templates-build.proj /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild vsintegration/fsharp-vsintegration-item-templates-build.proj /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild vsintegration/fsharp-vsintegration-deployment-build.proj /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild vsintegration/fsharp-vsintegration-unittests-build.proj  /p:Configuration=Release
    msbuild tests/fsharp/FSharp.Tests.fsproj /p:Configuration=Release
    src\update.cmd release -ngen
    tests\BuildTestTools.cmd release 

### 4. [Optional] Install the Visual F# IDE Tools 

**Note:** This step will install a VSIX extension into Visual Studio 2015 that changes the Visual F# IDE Tools 
components installed into Visual Studio 2015.  You can revert this step by disabling or uninstalling the addin.

For **Debug**:

1. Ensure that the VSIX package is uninstalled. In VS, select Tools/Extensions and Updates and if the package `VisualStudio.FSharp.EnableOpenSource` is installed, select Uninstall
1. Run ``debug\net40\bin\EnableOpenSource.vsix``

For **Release**:

1. Ensure that the VSIX package is uninstalled. In VS, select Tools/Extensions and Updates and if the package `VisualStudio.FSharp.EnableOpenSource` is installed, select Uninstall
1. Run ``release\net40\bin\EnableOpenSource.vsix``

Restart Visual Studio, it should now be running your freshly-built Visual F# IDE Tools with updated F# Interactive. 

### 5. [Optional] Clobber the F# SDK on the machine

**Note:** Step #3 below will clobber the machine-wide installed F# SDK on your machine. This replaces the ``fsi.exe``/``fsiAnyCpu.exe`` used by Visual F# Interactive and the ``fsc.exe`` used by ``Microsoft.FSharp.targets``.  Repairing Visual Studio 2015 is currently the only way to revert this step.  

For **Debug**:

1. Run ``vsintegration\update-vsintegration.cmd debug`` (clobbers the installed F# SDK)

For **Release**:

1. Run ``vsintegration\update-vsintegration.cmd release`` (clobbers the installed F# SDK)


### Notes on the build

1. The `update.cmd` script adds required strong name validation skips, and NGens the compiler and libraries. This requires admin privileges.
1. The compiler binaries produced are "private" and strong-named signed with a test key.
1. Some additional tools are required to build the compiler, notably `fslex.exe`, `fsyacc.exe`, `FSharp.PowerPack.Build.Tasks.dll`, `FsSrGen.exe`, `FSharp.SRGen.Build.Tasks.dll`, and the other tools found in the `lkg` directory.
1. The overall bootstrapping process executes as follows
 - We first need an existing F# compiler. We use the one in the `lkg` directory. Let's assume this compiler has an `FSharp.Core.dll` with version X.
 - We use this compiler to compile the source in this distribution, to produce a "proto" compiler, dropped to the `proto` directory. When run, this compiler still relies on `FSharp.Core.dll` with version X.
 - We use the proto compiler to compile the source for `FSharp.Core.dll` in this distribution.
 - We use the proto compiler to compile the source for `FSharp.Compiler.dll`, `fsc.exe`, `fsi.exe`, and other binaries found in this distribution.
